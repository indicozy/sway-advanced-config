# sway-dotfiles-script
A Bash script for Sway Window Manager with preconfigured themes:
* Windows 98/XP/7/10;
* MacOS 1.0/15.0;
* Ubuntu 20.04;
* Additional two Sway themes.
## Themes and Code are ready!
There are configs for some themes, be free to use them!
The code is WM-free, meaning **you can use it with other WMs just by adding your configs to "config" folder and editing the reload command.**



The script has several features:
* Basic GUI
* Easy and intuitive usage
* Notifications
* Auto-backup your previous config up to 8 histories at "~/Documents/sway_configs_saved"
* Hotkeys are automatically appended to the Sway config, so there is no need to manually add it to your config!

# Usage
* Ctrl+Super+Space - Open GUI of the app
* Ctrl+Super+s - Save your config to the folder ~/Documents/sway_configs_saved
* Ctrl+Super+(1-9) - change theme tho N'th theme
* Ctrl+Super+(left/right) - change theme to the next/previous one
* ./changetheme next - next theme
* ./changetheme MacOSBigSur - change to an exact theme
* ./changetheme (number) - change theme to an N'th theme
* ./changetheme goback (or fuckgoback) - if you was editing your theme and suddenly used this script which overwrites your config, this command gets your overwritten files back, up to 7 saves!
* ./changetheme fuck - well, it's just for fun, if you somehow messed up your config and want to swear at my code, feel free to do that, but I will defend myself ━╤デ╦︻(▀̿̿Ĺ̯̿̿▀̿ ̿)

### Before using a script, make sure that the "path" value is pointing to the location of the script
(I couldn't make it automatic, because Sway is launching it from Desktop)

Hope you found this repo helpful/inspirational!
If you want to tip for a coffee, I will add bitcoin/monero/dogecoin later.

P.S. FYI I'm total noob in git and bash. I made the code to be as safe as possible (so there's no rm -rf ~), yet if you have some programming skills, please check my bash script ( ͡^ ͜ʖ ͡^)
